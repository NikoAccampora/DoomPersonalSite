    You take the role of Malcolm Striker - a former member of Earth's special forces that main job was to obviously save the Earth on daily basis. A loner and a mercenary now, who's only purpose is to find and finish off his dreaded nemesis - Vladimir Vladimir, a one-man factory of lust for world domination. His shadowy presence is ever pervasive, and despite all of these ugly things getting in your way and giving you a reason to expend shotgun shells in some as ugly faces, such as invasion from outer dimension, caused by accident thanks to UAC, for which sure as 'Hell' V.V. is responsible for - perhaps one day you will finally face him upon the field of battle to avenge his lost love and the tragic refrigerator accident. Where that damned villain could be now, anyway?
